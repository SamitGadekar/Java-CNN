# Java-CNN

## Overview

Java-CNN is a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in Java, built as an extension and learning exercise inspired by the [CNN\_Tutorial](https://github.com/evarae/CNN_Tutorial) by evarae. This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of CNNs by coding them from scratch, following a structured approach to neural network design and optimization.

## Inspiration

This project is based on the [Convolutional Neural Network Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MMonOWGe0M&list=PLpcNcOt2pg8k_YsrMjSwVdy3GX-rc_ZgN) by evarae, which walks through the development of a CNN in Java. While following the tutorial, I have implemented additional improvements, optimizations, and experiments to enhance performance and generalization.

## Features

* Handcrafted convolutional, fully connected, and max pool layers without external deep learning libraries
* Backpropagation implementation for learning
* Training and evaluation on the MNIST dataset
* Functionality for saving and loading trained networks to and from files
* GUI for creating, testing, and interacting with models

## Requirements

* Java 8+

## Setup and Execution

1.
